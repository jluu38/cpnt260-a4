## Summary

This is a continuation from the previous two CPNT260 assignments.

This hero section was made with the intention of departing from the trend of hero sections composed of a single banner image. Asymmetry and flatness are important as there are many objects on the viewport, but the call-to-action button (would lead to a tickets page) is the same colour as the brighter side of the page; this is done to hopefully draw the eye.

## Comments (removed from HTML and CSS)

- Super proud I was able to fix/learn from some issues from previous iterations of this site template:
  - Nav bar's size is no longer fluctuating when the ticket symbol hovers into the text!
  - Mobile isn't breaking like it used to. Definitely could be improved, but issues with margins/overflowing weren't an issue this time
- Nav bar is improved, but the checkbox hack for mobile seems just okay because the hamburger icon's transition is tied to it being checked (ie easing in but not out until pressed again).
- Call-to-action went through MANY versions because it was difficult finding room for it once the page is smaller.
  - Opted to remove an SVG to make room.
  - Also kept the button bigger than the heading, mostly for a solid block of colour - hope it's not taboo?
- About the reset.css, I've been carrying over code from previous assignments and haven't really thought about what works for me yet -- hope it's not too vanilla.
