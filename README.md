## Summary

Continued from assignment 2, this is now the *Coming Soon* page. The goal for the site is entirely focused on advertising future/current film screenings.

An image gallery to display upcoming/current showings is most effective as it is easy to identify film posters and to read figure captions for titles and showtimes.

## Comments (removed from the html and css files)

- Lifted gallery grid code from Dannie Vinther (attributed below). My attempts remain in the CSS file. I could only achieve three-columns to two-columns to one column, and not three to one as instructed.
- Vintage posters came in a variety of sizes. Had difficulties with keeping them responsive AND properly centered/positioned, so I specified their heights.
  - Specifying their widths made for uneven heights and looked weird.
- Mistakenly added alts to FontAwesome icons last time - now changed to aria-labels.
- Also left alts blank for posters. General consensus is that it's redundant with figcaptions?
- Also lifted squiggly line animation code. Couldn't properly execute svg animation, and figured it was okay since it's not relevant to the assignment.
- Page broke down in mobile; fixed, but still breaks down around 300px.
  - On mobile, when the hamburger menu is opened, the page expands with a horizontal scrollbar. I think it's from the animation.
